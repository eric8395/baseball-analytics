Like any other business, a major league baseball team operates very similarly. A franchise has to consider many factors for success including winning and the budgeting for success. Success begins and ends with the construction of a roster and translating a roster of players into wins. But how does a team decide how much they should be paying their roster of players? 

## Business Understanding

Building a competitive team facing a limited budget is a predicament many MLB teams face. There are the big market teams like the New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Boston Redsox that are allowed a larger budget than most other teams. How can the smaller market teams even compete when they can't afford the superstar players to help with winning? This is the foundation of Michael Lewis's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball"> Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game </a> and the basis for this project.

The goal is to construct a machine learning model that can predict the salaries of MLB hitters and pitchers using historical baseball data collected from the last 20 years. Additionally, we want to better understand which statistics in baseball contribute the most to predicting overall team wins. 

Using these models, we can better understand the *value* of the baseball player and identify which players are potentially undervalued or overvalued when constructing a roster of players.
